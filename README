things to work on:

easier signup - all thats needed is really just email/password instead of the 
restful authentication defaults.  also would be nice to just start using feeds 
without login and then deciding to signup later if one wanted to save the feedlist.
feed discovery - so u don't need to put in exact feed url
feed tolerance - some feeds are not very well parsed by feedtools (eg. ebert's 
blog)
local caching - use html5 local storage to have an offline copy
load feeds faster - right now it only checks a feed for updates at most once a 
day per feed.  also instead of loading all feeds and sorting entries by date 
when they are all done, be better to start loading feeds by ajax one by one.
see more entries option - right now it is hardcoded to displaying about 30 feeds 
max
resolve ajax corner case bugs - if u r logged off the ajax to mark something 
read will break. it should get main page to goto login. also just more robust 
error handling and messaging for the ajax calls
